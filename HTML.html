        <h1>Why The School Should Unblock Python/Python Libraries</h1>
        <h4>I LOVE Python and I know how useful it is. I was going to use Python, HTML, CSS, CPP, JS and BF; ""difficulties"" arrived.</h4>
        <h4 class="h42">The libraries are blocked, opening the files is blocked, the only thing not block is creating said files. So this website is about snake.</h4>
        <h3>Enjoy.</h3>
